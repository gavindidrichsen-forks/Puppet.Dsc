# the below modules will need to remain with in this file, commented out, as there is a mismatch between their naming on the forge and PS Gallery.
# their names, as they appear on PSGallery, are added to the default list above.
# a7ziparchivedsc
# xhyper_v
# xphp (this module is broke upstream and will not be included in the default list see https://github.com/dsccommunity/xPhp/issues/13. 
# Its worth noting that the latest version is already on the forge, and that it is also no longer maintained.)
