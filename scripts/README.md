# scripts

## Description

Before doing any `Puppet.dsc` work on a windows server, there are a number of pre-requisite operations that must be performed.  This directory contains scripts for development purposes to perform these operations.  For example, the `install.ps1` installs powershell modules, configures winrm, etc.  The `winrm` directory contains a script for configuring just the winrm.
